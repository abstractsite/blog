> Test-Driven Development, or [TDD][1], is a practice in which you test your code before writing it and then write your code so as to successfully run the tests.

Found myself in the rather common situation in which I was tasked with breaking down an otherwise complex and (to me) relatively new concept to a non-programmer.

- &#8220;What have you been upto today?&#8221;, she says whilst washing up some plates in the kitchen.

- &#8220;Coding. You know.&#8221; I say, stepping into the kitchen for a better view.

- &#8220;Ah&#8221;

- &#8220;Tried something new today actually&#8221;

- &#8220;Yeah? What was that?&#8221;

- &#8220;I read this thing a while back and have always wondered how anyone could work like that. It seemed to defy common sense in so many ways.&#8221;

- &#8220;What was it?&#8221;

- &#8220;Its called Test-Driven Development&#8221;

- &#8220;&#8230;&#8221;

- &#8220;Haha, well, it basically means you test your program before writing it&#8221;

- &#8220;&#8230;how does that work?&#8221;

- &#8220;Exactly! Right? <img src='http://abstractfactory.io/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> Defies common sense. How can you try something before you have it?&#8221;

- &#8220;Right&#8221;

- &#8220;But so, it works kinda like this. Lets say you&#8217;re working on that door&#8221; \*pointing at the door next to the kitchen\* &#8220;Lets say that door isn&#8217;t there and you are going to make a door for this empty doorway.&#8221;

- &#8220;Okay&#8221;

- &#8220;But before you start, you&#8217;re gonna want&#8217;o know know a few things. Like which side to put the handle on, how high up the door the handle should be put and so on.&#8221;

- &#8220;Right&#8221;

- &#8220;So if you were to walk up to the empty space, and sort of imagine the door being there, you could put your hand out and feel for the right height. And while you&#8217;re at it, you could take notice of which hand you just used to do that. At that point you&#8217;ve already got the most intuitive side to put the handle on, and in the next couple of seconds you&#8217;d figure out which height would be most comfortable to you.&#8221;

- &#8220;Ahaaa&#8221;

- &#8220;That&#8217;s all there is to it. You&#8217;ve now tested your door before making it. Think of how much longer it&#8217;d take you if you had to drill the hole, put the handle in and mount the door every time you wanted to get a feel for the handle?&#8221;
