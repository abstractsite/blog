Since heading off to <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">StartupWeekend</a> <a href="http://london.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">#London</a> on the 12th of July 2013, Pipi has been featured in <a href="http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/features/1192254/" target="_blank">Campaign Magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.prweek.com/uk/news/1192254/52-hour-businesses/" target="_blank">PRWeek</a>, gotten <a href="http://www.pipi.io/" target="_blank">a website</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pipisoftware" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pipi_io" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account but most importantly &#8211;  I now have a team.

We&#8217;re a hacker, <span></span>hustler<span></span> and designer fulfilling the three D&#8217;s of responsibility &#8211; Design, Data and Distribution &#8211; and we&#8217;ve been hard at work trying to figure out how to deliver the first pass of Pipi to you guys.

<div>
  For the Alpha version of Pipi, I&#8217;m envisioning two separate tools for File Handling and Metadata respectively.</p> <h3>
    Perfect File Handling
  </h3>
  
  <div>

<div>
  As we started to collect feedback from various studios (the deep pockets), technical artists (the integrators) and artists (our end-users), it became clear very early that the first step towards establishing a foundation within a production would be to properly manage their file-system.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Files are super important in any sort of work, especially so in an environment with potentially thousands of files generated, created and modified on a daily basis by the many people throughout a production.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  There needs to versioning, categorisation, metadata and above all &#8211; consistency. And then there&#8217;s the one law that such a tool abides to above all &#8211; it must do no harm.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  For the alpha, we&#8217;ll introduce the <b>Dashboard</b> how it solves these matters.
</div>

<div>
  <h3>
    Meta.. what?
  </h3>
</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>
  A file cannot tell you why it exists. It cannot tell you about where it came from or what it&#8217;s purpose is. For these matters, there is the concept of Metadata, or &#8220;data about data&#8221;.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  One of the first barriers I faced when envisioning Pipi was how to store metadata together with the content I was looking to enrich. As it turns out, this has been done to death in the past and the go-to solution for doing so is to use a database, such as <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  But to us (you and me), metadata is so much more than just text. Metadata means screenshots per version, reference videos per shot, audio for animators as well as key/value pairs for automation throughout the pipeline. Short text, long text, tables and hierarchies of text, all of that is part of the data about our content.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  For the Alpha version of Pipi, I&#8217;ll introduce <b>Augment</b> and how it solves this in a way which is both easy to learn (no coding required) and infinitely scalable and adaptable (any OS, any content, any data-format, any size)
