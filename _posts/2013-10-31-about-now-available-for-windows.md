We did it! <span style="line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;">Take a spin with our first ever release of an early version of our first software. First!</span>

About is a metadata utility you can use in Asset Management by attaching metadata to folders in your project, such as frame rate, start and end frame of shots or history information of published assets.

We built About to use in our greater endeavour of Pipi, but feel it also has great potential on its own.

We hope you do too!
