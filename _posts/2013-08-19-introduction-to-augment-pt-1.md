A day in your local library. You push the door in, look for your favorite book and bring it to the counter. As the pretty receptionist looks at you for a brief moment, she scribbles today&#8217;s date along with your name onto a card in the front cover of the book and repeats the process into her computer.

You smile, give her a gentle nod of the head and return to work.

Once back behind your desk, you open the cover, look at her scribble and think:

<pre><em>"So this is metadata, huh"</em></pre>

Mhm. The book now contains both notes on [API Design][1] along with a name and a date.

The book itself is full of data. The data scribbled on its inside then is data* about* that data. It tells you something related to the book &#8211; in this case who borrowed it and when &#8211; but it is not the book itself.

Lets return to our story and take this one step further.

You put the book aside and continue working on your shot. But, you&#8217;ve neglected to jot down the frame-range you were working in.

In this case, the shot is like a book. It contains information &#8211; geometry, shaders, animation and so on. The frame-range is part of the shot, but it isn&#8217;t the shot itself. What is it?

<pre>Hint: Its <em>about</em> the shot</pre>

### So what do you do?

*a)* You could go to your supervisor, lead or anyone who knows and ask.

*b)* You and your team could have stored it in a spreadsheet (in the cloud, of course).

*c) *You could open the cover and look inside.

<pre><em>length: <strong>86 frames</strong>
start: <strong>1001</strong>
end: <strong>1086</strong></em></pre>

Now its only a matter of figuring out, how do you treat a shot as though it were a book?
